notes

what does visibility component need?

	reading:
		invisible tag
		visibility (for a particular viewer...)

		node3d position
		vision target positions


	writing:
		positions must be writable though, and probably update somewhere....
		I just need to know if there's LOS to this thing

	other things about the character? naaaaaaaah
	I think the expensive stuff should be done here, and the messy stuff should be done in gdscrip
